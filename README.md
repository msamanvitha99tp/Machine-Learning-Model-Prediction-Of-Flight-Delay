# Machine-Learning-Model-Prediction-Of-Flight-Delay
This model predicts if there is any delay in flight time. 
To do this we first used XGBoost Classifier and found if there will be any delay in the flight or not.
If there is a delay in flight we predict by how much time it will get delayed using linear regression.
